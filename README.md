Home Data Logging
=================

This is a collection of software that I am developing to do data logging around my house.  The high-level duties of this software are:

* collect weather observations from an Arduino based weather station
* collect indoor temperature readings from Arduino based sensor nodes
* publish the weather data to Weather Underground
* present non-weather data on web pages
